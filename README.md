# Accommodation Management

The Accommodation Management project allows users to find places of accommodation i.e Hotels, hostels, PGs, etc. in whichever city you wish to visit. It lets you book the place (no actual payment system implemented). Using the same web application, owners of the accommodation can view all the booking for their place and view the details of the person who booked. This project was inspired from Airbnb.

## Technologies Used:

* **Apache Tomcat** - It is the web server used.
* **JSP** - It is used to embed Java logic into HTML.
* **Java** - It is the back-end language used to serve the pages and interact with the database.
* **MySQL Server** - It is used as a Database to store all the data.
* **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** - For front-end

**This project was done as part of Engineering curriculum. This was my CSE 5th semester DBMS Project.**
